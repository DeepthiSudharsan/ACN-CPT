Configure a secure network:
Implement the security measures in the router and switches for a secure access from a remote host.

Requirements
Router
Switches
PC

Connection
1.Router to SW0 - GigbitEthernet0/1
2. Router to SW1 - GigbitEthernet0/0
3. SW0 to PC0 - FastEthernet 0/2  
4. SW0 to Laptop - FastEthernet 0/3
5. SW1 to PC1 - FastEthernet 0/2


Steps to configure a secure network:
1.Configure the Router
2. Configure SW0



Step 1:Router Configuration:

a. Enter configuration mode:
en
config t

b. Assign IP address
hostname R1
interface g0/0/1
ip address 192.168.22.1 255.255.255.0 # Instead this use your register number. Eg: CB.EN.U4AIE19010, then the IP address is 192.168.10.1 
no shutdown
exit



interface g0/0/0
ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0 # Make changes here accordingly .i.e 192.168.80.1
no shutdown

exit


c. Assign message for unauthorized access
banner motd @ Unauthorized @

d. Implement security over the router
security password min-length 10
line console 0
exec-timeout 7 0 
password Deepthi1234 # The password should include 'part of your name' instead of 'Amrita'.
login

#This is for SSH connection by a remote host
line vty 0 4
exec-timeout 7 0 
password Deepthi1234 # Make changes here
login
transport input ssh

# Create the domain
ip domain-name amritaAIE.org
crypto key generate rsa
1024
username Amritaadmin secret Deepthi1234  # Make changes here


#Encrypt the password and fix the number of incorrect attempts
enable secret Deepthi1234
service password-encryption
login block-for 45 attempts 3 within 100
end

exit


Step 2: Configure a switch
a. Enter configuration mode:
en
config t

b. Assign IP address
hostname SW0
interface vlan 1
ip address 192.168.22.254 255.255.255.0 # Make appropriate changes here
no shutdown
exit

c. Assign message for unauthorized access
banner motd @ Unauthorized @

d. Implement security over the router
line console 0
exec-timeout 7 0
password Deepthi1234 # Make changes here
login

#This is for SSH connection by a remote host
line vty 0 4 
exec-timeout 7 0
password Deepthi1234 # Make changes here
login
enable secret Deepthi1234
service password-encryption 
interface range fastEthernet0/4-24,GigabitEthernet0/2
shutdown
end
exit


Connecting from the remote host:
SSH -L Amritaadmin 192.168.2.1 # Make changes here i.e. 192.168.80.2

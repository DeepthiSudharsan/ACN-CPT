To configure a Firewall for a small network:
The configuration is done via line console from PC0

Components:
 Server
 Router - 1841
 Security device - AS 5505
 PC
 Switch

Connections:
1.Security device to Router - Ethernet0/0
2.Security device to Switch - Ethernet0/1
3.Switch to PC0 - FastEthernet0/2
4.Switch to PC1 - FastEthernet0/3
5. Router to Server - FastEthernet0/1
6. PC0 to Security device - Console

Note: In PC0 chose RS 232 is chosen to connect with Security device


Steps to configure a Firewall for a small network:
Step 1. Configure the server
Step 2. Configure Firewall via PC0
Step 3. Configure Router
Step 4: DHCP and DNS configuration and the path
Step 5: Create access-list


Step 1:Configure the server:
IP address     : 8.8.8.8
Subnet mask    : 255.255.255.0
Default gateway: 8.8.8.1



Step 2:Configure firewall:

a.Enable
b. Check for IP address assigned through DHCP and remove them
c. Assign new IP address


a. Enter configuration mode:
In PC0:
enable
show running

b Check for IP address assigned through DHCP and remove them
configure terminal
interface vlan 1
no ip address
no dhcp address 192.168.1.5-192.168.1.6 inside
end

show running

c. Assign new IP address
configure terminal
interface vlan 1
ip address 172.16.1.1 255.255.255.0  # Instead this use your register number. Eg: CB.EN.U4AIE19010, then the IP address is 172.16.10.1 and subnet mask is same
nameif inside
security-level 100
exit

inter e0/1
switchport access vlan 1
exit

interface vlan 2
ip address 203.1.1.2 255.255.255.0 # Change according to your register number. Eg: CB.EN.U4AIE19010, then the IP address is 203.1.1.10
no shutdown
nameif outside
security-level 0
exit

inter e0/0
switchport access vlan 2
exit


Step 3:Configure Router
a. Enter configuration mode:
enable
configure terminal

b Assign IP address
host ISP
inter f0/0
ip address 203.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown

inter f0/1
ip address 8.8.8.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit

Step 4: DHCP and DNS configuration and the path
Configure Server
1. Enable DHCP configuration mode in PCs
2. DHCP and DNS configuration


In PC0:
dhcpd address 172.16.1.5-172.16.1.6 inside # Instead this use your register number. Eg: CB.EN.U4AIE19010, then the IP address range is 172.16.10.5-172.16.10.6 
dhcpd dns 8.8.8.8 interface inside 
end

show running

Configure the default route and dynamic route on ISP
In PC0:
configure terminal 
route outside 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.1.1.1
exit

In Router:
router ospf 1
network 203.1.1.1 0.0.0.255 area 1
network 8.8.8.0 0.0.0.255 area 1


In PC0:
configure terminal
object network LAN
subnet 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 # Instead this use your register number. Eg: CB.EN.U4AIE19010, then the IP address is 172.16.10.0 and subnet mask is same
nat (inside,outside) dynamic interface
exit

Step 5: Create access-list
configure terminal
access-list in_to_internet extended permit tcp any any
access-list in_to_internet extended permit icmp any any
access-group in_to_internet in interface outside
